TOOLS:
------

You have access to the following tools:
{tool_index}

To use a tool, please use the following format:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
```

Some tools will return Observations in the format of `Block(<identifier>)`. This will represent a successful completion
of that step and can be passed to subsequent tools, or returned to a user to answer their questions.

When you have a final response to say to the Human, or if you do not need to use a tool, you MUST use the format:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
AI: [your final response here]
```

If a Tool generated an Observation that includes `Block(<identifier>)` and you wish to return it to the user, ALWAYS
end your response with the `Block(<identifier>)` observation. To do so, you MUST use the format:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
AI: [your response with a suffix of: "Block(<identifier>)"].
```

Make sure to use all observations to come up with your final response.
You MUST include `Block(<identifier>)` segments in responses that generate images or audio.
